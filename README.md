# Starcoder42
### Dylan Gatlin
This is my own code library. It has many cool tools using the numpy and
sympy libraries. Everything tries to be in snake_case, but dictionary keys are
still in CapitalCase. For more extensions on this involving sympy, try
starcoder42.math. It's recommended you import this via
```
import starcoder42 as s
import starcoder42.math
```

## Notable features
s.reload: A function to reload packages
s.estimate_rgb: A function to give a color of a spectra
s.find_index: A function that can find the closest corresponding index, even if
    your guess isn't in the array
s.describe: A function to describe the contents of a multidimensional array


## A note on ftarcoder42
I also wrote ftarcoder42, which is intended to be under starcoder42. In old
 english, there was a lost character, the 'long s', which looks like an f but
 is pronounced as an s. Since fortran is almost as old as English, I figured
 the name would be fitting. It has several routine that are faster than
 starcoder42, but it's not currently packaged with starcoder42 in a usable way.
